IMPORTANT: To keep event and tournament statuses up to date, you MUST keep Celery Beat running!

- Celery Beat is scheduled to run the status update task every 5 minutes.
- Command to start Celery Beat:

celery -A campus_rpg beat -l info

- Command to start Celery worker (in another terminal):

celery -A campus_rpg worker -l info

If Celery Beat is not running, event/tournament statuses will NOT update automatically.

TODO NEXT STEPS:
- Add filtering, searching, and pagination to all list endpoints (teams, tournaments, events, shop, news, etc.)
- Add permissions to restrict admin actions (e.g., archiving, deleting, approving)
- Add endpoints for tournament/event history (archive)
- Add endpoints for live bracket updates and match results
- Add endpoints for team invitations, applications, and approvals
- Add endpoints for shop filtering and purchase history
- Add endpoints for calendar aggregation (events, tournaments, news by date)
- Add notification endpoints for marking as read/unread and fetching history
- Add admin endpoints for dashboard analytics
- Add tests for all critical endpoints and business logic
- Document all endpoints and business logic
